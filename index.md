1. [`R`, the actual programming language.](https://www.r-project.org)
    - Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version.
1. [RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with `R`.](http://www.rstudio.com/)
    - Note, you must have `R` installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with `R`.

The popularity of `R` is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book!

The following few chapters will serve as a whirlwind introduction to `R`. They are by no means meant to be a complete reference for the `R` language, but simply an introduction to the basics that we will need along the way. Several of the more important topics will be re-stressed as they are actually needed for analyses.
